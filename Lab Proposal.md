# Final-Project-Ideas
Any recommendations for final project? (Python exclusively)

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Typing speed test 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be kind of like a game where the user's typing speed will be determined by a given sentence. It'll measure their words per minute, time they have used finished
finished typing, and their accuracy. Accuracy (Spacing, special/capitial letters, numbers) 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Just measuring a user's typing skill by determining their speed and accuracy. Features will include several background images and icons attached in python to make the layout
of the screen. In addition making sentence for the users to type hopefully getting the sentence to make sense not just typing random words on screen. Making sure the users
can reset and run the program if they wanted to.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
If planning to combine with 1051's final project with other course final project, I would include elements like multiplayer as example from the pong project. Somehow getting
two users to type on the same screen with different scores for each individual. Adding leaderboards that would save the top score. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
No one of now. This will be a solo project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Good outcomes generating random coherent sentences, scoring works properly as intended, display works well, properly running and resetting game, timer that reads how long the 
user took to finish. These have to be accomplished or else the game is unfinished. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Better outcome if I can add leaderboards, longer sentence structures, add other variables to score. Possibly making the sentence longer and more difficult I can accomplish
before deadline.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Best outcome if everything mention above works, if I can include multiplayer or typing against a bot would be amazing, making different difficulty. Making it multiplayer but
I would rather have it user go against bot. This would add more variety and challenge if I can pull it off. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
New skills I would need to require are how to attach image files with python screen, how to code a time counter properly, updating screen when finished or to reset.
Topic like timer, python file reading, and updating screen could be the right topic to research on.
