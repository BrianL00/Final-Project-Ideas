#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have programmed first part of the scoring accuracy but haven't finish with the other scoring base on time. I have picked out a couple image to use for my background and layout
of my project. Haven't finish properly working the timer and resetting.  

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
Proper timer, scoring fully, random sentences, making longer or complicated sentences, game resetting, other user inputs. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Not much just need to finish programming and decide whether or not to make another bot with it to compete if that is the case it is something I need to learn to do as well.
