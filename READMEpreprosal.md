# Final-Project-Ideas
Any recommendations for final project? (Python exclusively)

# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Im interested in making a game as I done that before the first year of Temple. It wasn’t with Python but it was pretty satisfying watching it work. Not sure what kind of game I want to make yet. I do want it to have some level of complexity but not too difficult to code.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Not sure as of now. I will ask around individuals that have the same interest.


## Do you have any questions of your own?
If I do plan to collaborate how should I divide the work load? Making sure the project I’m doing is around my level of comfort.
